Test project showing off speed of Parse development. I will add info / documentation to this README file soon, but in the meantime feel free to contact me. The app is currently configured to hook up to a Parse App under my account, as well as Facebook & Twitter Apps created by myself as well. (The project also has a bundle ID for my own Apple developer account.) Theoretically, I think you should be able to set all of these values to those appropriate for freshly created apps by yourself. If you need help, let me know.
